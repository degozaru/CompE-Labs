#CompE375 Labs

Done by Vincent Chan, RedID 815909699.

All work is written by myself with knowledge i've accumliated over my student career unless noted. Please take a look to sample my programming style.

Included is a document of our assignment.

##Installation and utulization

I only included my modified code in this repository. To utulize the code, you must include the librarys included in the labs, as well as have a STM32f0x8 discovery board to upload the code onto.

###Lab 1

Sorting

###Lab 2

Bit operations, format modifiers

###Lab 3

Structs, addressing struct variables

###Lab 4

We are provided with code to be flashed onto a micocontroller. We are tasked with modifying this code to fit the specifications included in the document. This was done using the EWARM IDE. Lab 4 and lab 5 are labs to get us to explore our options for embedded programming.

###Lab 5

We have to once again modify code to fit the program's specifications. See the document for more information. This was done using the Keil IDE. Lab 4 and 5 are labs to get us to explore our options for embedded programming.

###Lab 6

This lab is our first embedded program from scratch. The included document provides the outline for the code. Additionally, debouncing is a problem in this lab. We are introduced to interrupts, debouncing, and system core clocks.

###Lab 7

This lab introduces outside interfacing by the way of a hexpad. We are to read, decide, and change the blinkrate of the led according to the input from the hexpad.

###Lab 8

This lab introduces the speaker as an output. We are to configure the speaker to operate as specified by the document. More specifically, one speaker should maintain a 50% duty cycle, while another will maintain a 10% duty cycle.

###Lab 9

This lab involves creating a midi keypad. Functionality is included in the document provided.

###Lab 10

This lab involves creating a photosensitive theremin, and introduces us to the concept of an ADC conversion.

###Lab 11

This lab involves serial communications with the computer. We are using a Sparkfun FT232R breakout board.
